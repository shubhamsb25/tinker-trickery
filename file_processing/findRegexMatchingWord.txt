Finding list of words from a file using regex:

	# grep -o -E "[A-Z]{3}_[A-Z]{2}_[0-9]{14}" file.txt

	This will spit out all the words matching the regex


To find out only unique words from the above result we can use "sort" and "uniq" utilities:

	# grep -o -E "[A-Z]{3}_[A-Z]{2}_[0-9]{14}" file.txt | sort | uniq
	
	This will give unique words matching the specified regex

If we want to find out occurences of all the words matching the regex, we can use count flag of "uniq" utility:

	# grep -o -E "[A-Z]{3}_[A-Z]{2}_[0-9]{14}" file.txt | sort | uniq -c
	
	The will give all matching words with their occurences in file
